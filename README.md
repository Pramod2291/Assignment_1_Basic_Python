<!-- Task 1 -->

I took two user inputs, num1 and num2, and converted them to integers to perform arithmetic operations.

then I performed Addtion, Substraction, Multiplication, and Division operations respectively.


<!-- Task 2 -->

In Task 2, I took user input as strings because I needed the user’s first and last names. Then, in the print function, I displayed a string along with the values entered by the user.
